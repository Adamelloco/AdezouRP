AdezouRP is a FiveM server.

# Origin

The original base used is the [Arkadia](https://github.com/ItsikNox/FiveM-Arkadia_) one from [ItsikNox](https://github.com/ItsikNox). I give him a big thanks.

Big thanks to the FiveM and ESX community for all those open source resources.

# Modifications

Even if the base is not mine, I have given a lot of modification to it, only the basics resources are remaining.
